preference:
  # List at least 12 of your favourite hues in order of preference.
  # The first hue will be most dominant, followed by the second hue, and so on.
  # You may want to avoid the grayscale colors as they are mostly used
  # for text foreground and background.
  # You may want to put red, yellow and green at the end of the list,
  # as they are also used to indicate conditions.
